# Thyer-et-al-2021
Analysis code for Thyer et al 2021 (in prep). Working title: "Multivariate decoding of visual working memory load  provides evidence for item-based pointers". This is the code used to generate analysis and figures. Data will be made available on OSF. Put data in folder titled `data` in top directory. 

This decoding uses the [Mord](https://github.com/fabianp/mord) package which is a ordinal logistic regression package. Download the package and put it in a folder called `mord` in the top directory. Alternatively, just use the `sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` for slightly worse decoding accuracies.
